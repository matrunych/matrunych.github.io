<p>The foundation of all web design is the <strong>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)</strong>. It  is used for the layout of web pages hosted on the Internet. Unlike regular (“linear”) text, hypertext is a system of pages linked together. </p>
  <p>The entire <strong>World Wide Web</strong>  (World Wide Wed or WWW for short) can be represented as a single hypertext document. In fact, the user can go from one document to another using hyperlinks, and it does not matter to him whether the content displayed in his browser window are a single document or a system of many interconnected documents. </p>
    <p>This property of transparency for the user is common to all distributed systems, which include the World Wide Web. It should be noted that the Internet and the World Wide Web are not the same thing. The Internet is a network of networks, while the World Wide Web is a distributed system based on the Internet.

<p>
  <strong><i>HTML</i></strong> was created for the logical (semantic) markup of the document and is not intended to control the display of content on the user's screen or output to a printing device. However, for a long time it was improperly used to control visualization. The situation changed when   <strong><i>cascading style sheets (CSS)</i></strong>  were created. They are used to indicate to the browser how to display the contents of the web page.

</p>
   
<p>
  Thus, when creating web pages, you need to use HTML tags only for logical formatting. The way the web page content is displayed should be set using cascading CSS style sheets.
